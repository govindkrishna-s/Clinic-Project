## ‚ú® Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using email and password.

JWT-Powered API: The backend API is secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.

Book Appointments: An intuitive form allows users to book an appointment with a specific doctor. The system includes validation to prevent booking appointments in the past.

Manage Appointments: Logged-in users can view a list of their own upcoming appointments and have the option to delete them with a confirmation step.

Responsive Design: The React frontend is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
